-Encapsulation-
Setting private data fileds and the corresponding methods to set them and return them is
the reflection of encapsulation. So I changed code in Log for now, for better maintenance.

-Fix-
The parameter order in the constructor of Obstacle is different from that of Log. 
So I make the parameter orders of them exactly the same for maintenance.

-Private-
I tried to make data fileds private for protection purpose
